## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Pre-milestone: tmux Option A chosen over RPC Option B — pi JSONL protocol not yet stable
- Pre-milestone: Session model is `create.mode: "explicit"`, `capture.mode: "off"`, resume via `--session {uuid}`
- Pre-milestone: `newSessionCommand` field identified as required precondition before pi ships

### Blockers/Concerns

- pi warns `tmux extended-keys is off` — handled in Phase 3 BLOCK-02
- `fd` download fails on GitHub API rate limit — cosmetic, non-blocking, filtered by NORM-01
